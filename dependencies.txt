====================
    Semantic Versioning
    #in package.json:
    "express":"^4.18.2" ==> X.Y.Z => X(4)=Major version; Y(18)=Minor Version; Z(2)=Patch version

    "^" means if we were to run npm update <package> it'll only update the minor or patch version and won't update the major version i.e. it can become 4.18.3 but never 5.0.0

    "~" means to only npm update will only/can only update the patch version, not even the minor version can be changed
